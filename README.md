# AWS-Cloud-ReArchitecture-Cloud-Native-Migration-

## Overview
This project outlines the re-architecture of applications and workloads to optimize agility and business continuity using AWS cloud-native services.

## Challenges Addressed
- High operational overhead.
- Struggles with uptime and scaling.
- High CapEx (Capital Expenditure) and OpEx (Operational Expenditure) costs.
- Manual processes that are difficult to automate.

## AWS-Based Solution
- **Automation:** Reducing manual intervention.
- **Cloud Setup:** Pay-as-you-go model to optimize costs.
- **Flexible Infrastructure:** Adoption of **IaaS, PaaS, SaaS** models.
- **Ease of Infrastructure Management:** Leveraging managed AWS services.

## AWS Services Utilized
- **Elastic Beanstalk**
- **Amazon EC2** (VM for Tomcat Application Server)
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
- **Auto Scaling**
- **Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service)
- **Amazon S3**
- **CloudFront** (CDN)
- **Elastic Cache**
- **Active MQ**
- **Route 53** (DNS Service)

## Architecture Overview
The architecture is designed using:
- **EC2 instances** with ELB & Auto Scaling.
- **Elastic File System (EFS)** for storage.
- **RDS for database management.**
- **Elastic Cache & Active MQ** for optimized performance.
- **CloudFront & Route 53** for content delivery and domain management.

## Benefits of Re-Architecture
- **Scalability:** Automated scaling with AWS Auto Scaling.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduced upfront costs with a pay-as-you-go model.
- **Reliability:** Enhanced uptime and performance with managed AWS services.
- **Security:** Improved security compliance with AWS best practices.
